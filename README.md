> [!Note]
> If you use Windows, it is highly recommended to complete the installation in the way presented below through [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).



1.  Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/bswck/project) on GitHub.

1.  [Install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).<br/>
    Poetry is an amazing tool for managing dependencies & virtual environments, building packages and publishing them.
    You might use [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx#readme) to install it globally (recommended):

    ```shell
    pipx install poetry
    ```

    <sub>If you encounter any problems, refer to [the official documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for the most up-to-date installation instructions.</sub>

    Be sure to have Python 3.8 installed—if you use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#readme), simply run:

    ```shell
    pyenv install 3.8
    ```

1.  Clone your fork locally and install dependencies.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/project path/to/project
    cd path/to/project
    poetry env use $(cat .python-version)
    poetry install
    ```

    Next up, simply activate the virtual environment and install pre-commit hooks:

    ```shell
    poetry shell
    pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type pre-push
    ```
